People seem to spend a great deal of time thinking about the past, yet they rarely do so in a positive light. They are always quick to recognize how bad their past actions were. However, they often fail to acknowledge the paradox this creates. If you now recognize a past action as bad, does that not mean it played a formative role in shaping your current moral code? Where would anyone be without such missteps?

We are not born into this world with a predetermined sense of right and wrong; this is something we must develop on our own. We shape our moral understanding through the people we interact with and the media we consume, but ultimately, these influences serve only as suggestions.

It is only through our own experiences that we determine what we find to be good or bad. Your past is what shapes your moral framework. It was because your past self did something and felt good about it that you now perceive a certain action as right, and the same holds true for the opposite.

Without our past mistakes, we would continue engaging in harmful behaviors without realizing their consequences. The very fact that you feel bad about something from your past means it played a crucial role in shaping who you are today; it forced you to see the world differently.

Our past actions should not be something we shy away from out of embarrassment, nor should they be something we dwell on in repentance. Instead, they should be analyzed, learned from, and ultimately left behind. Only by moving forward differently can we continue to grow, and only by making mistakes can we gain the resources necessary for growth.

Your life isnâ€™t over because you made a foolish decision, but that aspect of your thinking is, because you have since learned from your past. Do not regret the past; learn from it.
