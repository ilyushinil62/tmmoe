In the (admittedly unrefined and now deleted) first post of this blog, I briefly discussed the factors that influence our perceptions of right and wrong. One of those factors was media. And it is because of this that I view the constant hostility toward media containing problematic content as downright foolish; for it is not media that encourages the populace to partake in activities deemed wrong by society, but rather, it is mediaâ€™s depiction of such activities that pushes this belief.
