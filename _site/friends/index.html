    <div class="header">friends</div>
    <div class="friendheader">eyeorb.net</div>
    <div class="friendtext">My closest friend, and an extremely talented webdeveloper; I can't laud this webpage with
        enough praise. Every page is unique from one another, whilst still maintaining a consistent (in my opinion
        beautiful) gradient-heavy style. If you're at all interested in looking at a website unique from what you
        usually see, go here.</div>
    <div class="friendheader">moosyu.com</div>
    <div class="friendtext">All around cool guy; even if he has a tendency to rack up infractions within the Nekoweb
        community. His site goes through something of an identity crisis semi-frequently, but I find his reviews and
        blog posts to be quite interesting. Feel free to spam his guestbook on my behalf.</div>
    <div class="friendheader">jhorn.net</div>
    <div class="friendtext">I haven't known him for all that long, but we mysteriously seem to share the exact same
        thoughts on every subject. This website has an extremely unique, yet still highly legible style, and it's just
        fun to look through in general. If you're into writings from the indie web whatsoever, I highly recommend
        checking
        my man jhorn out.</div>
    <div class="friendheader">lel.nekoweb.org</div>
    <div class="friendtext">We're all friends with that one guy who's probably going to get arrested but he's lowkey
        chill so you still hang out with him; for me that's lel. He's a brilliant webdeveloper even if his current
        layout is a blatant ripoff of a Discord theme, and I think his blog is interesting in a schizophrenic way.</div>
    <div class="friendheader">gator.nekoweb.org</div>
    <div class="friendtext">One of the nicest people I know, and also one of the best looking websites I know (even if
        there's nothing on it ever :graah:). Really nice usage of a frutiger-aero-esque style, which I imagine will be
        even better once he further fleshes out the site.</div>
    <div class="friendheader">rice.place</div>
    <div class="friendtext">One of the first people I came to know in the Nekoweb community, and a generally helpful and
        kind individual. This site is one of the few 'cutesy' sites that I genuinely like, and I think you'll be hard
        pressed to find a page on this site which doesn't look amazing. At the time of writing this her site is in a
        hiatus, but I hope for it to return sooner rather than later.</div>
    <div class="friendheader">thinliquid.dev</div>
    <div class="friendtext">Even if he has the peculiar ability to alternate between amazing and god-awful layouts, he's
        still a nice guy who's made a lot of tools which I use. Definitely recommend checking out his site to check out
        his resources (and also if he has a good layout or not on the given day). </div>
