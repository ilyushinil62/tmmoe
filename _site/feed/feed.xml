    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the (admittedly unrefined and now deleted) first post of this blog, I briefly discussed the factors that influence our perceptions of right and wrong. One of those factors was media. And it is because of this that I view the constant hostility toward media containing problematic content as downright foolish; for it is not media that encourages the populace to partake in activities deemed wrong by society, but rather, it is media’s depiction of such activities that pushes this belief.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the (admittedly unrefined and now deleted) first post of this blog, I briefly discussed the factors that influence our perceptions of right and wrong. One of those factors was media. And it is because of this that I view the constant hostility toward media containing problematic content as downright foolish; for it is not media that encourages the populace to partake in activities deemed wrong by society, but rather, it is media’s depiction of such activities that pushes this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, media that is problematic in nature can largely be classified into two fields; however, it is possible for media to simultaneously exist in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first field, which henceforth shall be referred to as the &amp;quot;point-driven&amp;quot; form of problematic media, serves to bolster society’s views of right and wrong by portraying often uncomfortable subjects in a realistic light. This media doesn’t exist to endorse problematic actions but rather serves to depict the horrors of them. The best-known example of this, in my eyes, would be &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; and similar books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second field, which henceforth shall be referred to as the &amp;quot;escapism-driven&amp;quot; form of problematic media, largely exists to provide a source of escapism for the consumer. This is content that, while problematic in nature through the eyes of some, is grounded so loosely in reality that it’s foolish to take as social commentary. Think of the &lt;em&gt;Rance&lt;/em&gt; series and other eroge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen both of these fields criticized equally, but I felt the differentiation was important to make prior to writing further; albeit, I feel as though both mediums are equally valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest criticism I’ve seen for media with problematic content is that such media serves to glorify or make light of often reprehensible subjects. Yet, I’d argue that, in the case of point-driven media, the complete opposite is true. To reuse my earlier example, &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; has garnered a great deal of criticism over the years and has frequently appeared on banned book lists due to its depiction of racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to criticize this book or wish for it to be banned, in my eyes, is to do the complete opposite of advocating for greater moralism within our society. This is not a work that utilizes racism to push the agenda of some extremist party; it is a work that depicts racism as it truly appeared at one point in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD
If we are not to face the harsh realities of our world and recognize them within our creative works, then the very morals that critics of these works seek to uphold will fade with time. If we do not wish for people to learn morals through their own misfortunes, then it is ultimately the role of media to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, however, is a point that applies only to the aforementioned point-driven media, as opposed to escapism-driven media, which seems to be far more controversial in internet spaces as of late. This is media that is far easier to view as glorifying terrible actions due to its nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is media that serves not to provide social commentary but to entertain. And it’s in this purpose that I feel the hatred for such media grows rather pointless. Let us take the &lt;em&gt;Rance&lt;/em&gt; series as an example. &lt;em&gt;Rance&lt;/em&gt; is a series of games that revolve around, to put it nicely, repeated non-consensual sexual altercations. There is absolutely no societal commentary in this series, but similarly, there isn’t any advocacy for taking such actions into reality either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, depicting an overly fantastical scenario in which there are no clear rules or regulations set in place to counter such activities is not a mirror of reality. Rather, it is something solely created by the writer to entertain the delusions of the reader. This is not a piece of media that will drive people to take such actions in reality. And quite frankly, the very fact that they are actively seeking out a piece of media with such content suggests that they have no intention of ever doing so in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize a more widely known example, I’d compare it to the Call of Duty franchise. By depicting such actions in an overly dramatized and unrealistic manner, it is not advocating for gun violence; it is simply a form of predominantly mindless entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the escapism-driven sect of media revolves around. These works aren’t inherently there to push any given moral agenda, but similarly, they don’t exist to advocate for individuals to take morally reprehensible actions in reality. These are pieces of media actively sought out by individuals seeking entertainment, and there is little more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-wrap-this-up-simply-problematic-media-serves-a-notable-purpose-in-society-by-warning-us-of-the-horrors-of-many-terrible-actions-similarly-in-some-cases-it-also-serves-as-a-form-of-overly-satirized-entertainment-quite-frankly-i-don-t-feel-as-though-either-field-is-inherently-bad-or-good-it-s-simply-up-to-the-consumer-if-they-wish-to-indulge-in-either&quot;&gt;To wrap this up simply, problematic media serves a notable purpose in society by warning us of the horrors of many terrible actions. Similarly, in some cases, it also serves as a form of overly satirized entertainment. Quite frankly, I don’t feel as though either field is inherently bad or good—it’s simply up to the consumer if they wish to indulge in either.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are not to face the harsh realities of our world, and not to recognize them within our creative works, then the very morals which the critics of these works are seeking to uphold will fade with time. If we do not wish for the people of our world to learn morals through their own misfortunes, then it is ultimately the role of media to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, to depict an overly fantastical fantasy scenario in which there are no clear rules nor regulations set in place to counter such activities is not a mirror of reality. But rather, something solely created by the writer to entertain the delusions of the reader. This is not a piece of media which will drive people to take such actions in reality. And quite frankly, the very fact that they are actively seeking out a piece of media with such contents suggests that they have no intention to ever do so in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize a more widely known example, I&#39;d compare it to the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise, in that, by depicting such actions in an overly dramatized, and not whatsoever realistic manner, it is not advocating for gun violence; it is simply a form of predominantly mindless entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the escaism-driven sect of media revolves around, they aren&#39;t inherently there to push any given moral agenda, but similarly, they don&#39;t exist to advocate for individuals to take actions of moral reprehensibility in reality. These are pieces of media which are actively sought out by individuals seeking entertainment, and there is little more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up simply, problematic media does serve a rather notable purpose in society by warning us of the horrors of many terrible actions, but similarly, it also serves as a form of overly-satirized entertainment in some cases. Quite frankly, I don&#39;t feel as though either field is inherently bad nor good, it&#39;s simply up to the consumer if they wish to indulge in either.s&lt;/p&gt;
