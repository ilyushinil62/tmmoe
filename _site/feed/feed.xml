    <title>Problematic Media</title>
    <link href="https://example.com/blog/problematicmedia/" />
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://example.com/blog/problematicmedia/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the (admittedly unrefined and now deleted) first post of this blog I briefly discussed the factors which influence our perceptions right and wrong, one of those factors was media. And it is because of this, that I view the constant hostility toward media which contains problematic contents to be downright foolish; for it is not media which is encouraging the populace to partake in activities deemed as wrong by society, but rather, it is media&#39;s depiction of such activities that pushes this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes media that is problematic in nature can largely be classified into two fields, however, it is possible for media to simultaneously exist in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first field, which henceforth shall be referred to as the &#39;point-driven&#39; form of problematic media serves to bolster society&#39;s views of right and wrong by portraying often uncomfortable subjects in a realistic light. This media doesn&#39;t exist to endorse problematic actions, but rather, serves to depict the horrors of them. The best known example of this in my eyes would be &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; and similar books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second field, which henceforth shall be referred to as the &#39;escapism-driven&#39; form of problematic media largely exists for the purpose of providing a source of escapism for the consumer. This is content, which whilst problematic in nature through the eyes of some, is grounded so loosely in reality that it&#39;s foolish to take as social commentary. Think of the &lt;em&gt;Rance&lt;/em&gt; series and other eroge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen both of these fields criticized equally, but I felt as though the differentiation was important to make prior to writing further; albeit I feel as though both mediums are equally valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest criticism I&#39;ve seen for media with problematic contents is that such media serves to glorify, or make light of, often reprehensible subjects. Yet, I&#39;d argue in the case of point-driven media, the complete opposite is true. To reuse my earlier example, &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; has garnered a great deal of criticism over the years, and appeared frequently on banned book lists due to it&#39;s depiction of racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to criticize this book, or to wish for this book to be banned, in my eyes, is to do the complete opposite of advocating for greater moralism within our society. This is not a work which utilizes racism as to push the agenda of some extremist party; it is a work which depicts racism as it truly appeared at one point within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are not to face the harsh realities of our world, and not to recognize them within our creative works, then the very morals which the critics of these works are seeking to uphold will fade with time. If we do not wish for the people of our world to learn morals through their own misfortunes, then it is ultimately the role of media to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Role of the Past</title>
    <link href="https://example.com/blog/past/" />
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://example.com/blog/past/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People seem to spend a great deal of time thinking about the past, yet they rarely do so in a positive light. They are always quick to recognize how bad their past actions were. However, they often fail to acknowledge the paradox this creates. If you now recognize a past action as bad, does that not mean it played a formative role in shaping your current moral code? Where would anyone be without such missteps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not born into this world with a predetermined sense of right and wrong; this is something we must develop on our own. We shape our moral understanding through the people we interact with and the media we consume, but ultimately, these influences serve only as suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only through our own experiences that we determine what we find to be good or bad. Your past is what shapes your moral framework. It was because your past self did something and felt good about it that you now perceive a certain action as right, and the same holds true for the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without our past mistakes, we would continue engaging in harmful behaviors without realizing their consequences. The very fact that you feel bad about something from your past means it played a crucial role in shaping who you are today; it forced you to see the world differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our past actions should not be something we shy away from out of embarrassment, nor should they be something we dwell on in repentance. Instead, they should be analyzed, learned from, and ultimately left behind. Only by moving forward differently can we continue to grow, and only by making mistakes can we gain the resources necessary for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your life isnâ€™t over because you made a foolish decision, but that aspect of your thinking is, because you have since learned from your past. Do not regret the past; learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
